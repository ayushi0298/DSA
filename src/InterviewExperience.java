/* HASHEDIN EXPERIENCE:
    Round 1:selected
       1) Question: https:  //www.geeksforgeeks.org/efficiently-compute-sums-of-diagonals-of-a-matrix/
          I answered it correctly and provided the solution as expected.
       2) Question:https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/palindrome-pair-in-an-array-of-words-or-strings/
          I started with brute force and was not able to give efficient solution.

       Round 2:rejected
       many mistakes i made and various things im not aware of
       -java 8 features
       -hashcode making

       ACCOLITE EXPERIENCE:
       Round 1:
       1) Question: Count pair whose sum= k.
       2) Tell me the approach that u use for implementation for stack: I told him first Array and the LinkedList.
       3) multithreading deep mein(Unable to answer)
       4) Hashmap in deep (Able to answer)
       5) Autoboxing

       PUBLIICS SAPHIENT EXPERIENCE:(Rejected)
       1) JAVA 8 features: Streams and Lambda expressions: have written that
       2) Design patterns:
           1) write a singelton class- I was not able to write it
           2)Write a factory class: started but then he stopped
       3)Callable and Runnable- done
       4)Internal working of HashMap
       5)Multithreading- fork anf join and executer service
       6) Tools and all
       7) In pom.xml depedencies which we need to add.
