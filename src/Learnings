#HashMap and TreeMap:
HashMAp:
1) O(1) for lookup and insertion
2) A HashMap contains values based on the key.
3) contains unique elements,it may have one null key and multiple null values,It maintains no order.

TreeMap:
1) O(logn) for lookup and insertion
2) It contains only unique elements,It cannot have null key but can have multiple null values.
3) It is same as HashMap instead maintains ascending order.

#Difference between string and a stream:
--> we can traverse string a lot of times to get output but stream can be traversed only once.
